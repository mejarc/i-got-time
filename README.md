# I Got Time For That

Developed by [Melanie Archer](http://twobanjos.com).

A chore management tool that pays homage to the marvelous [To-->Done app](http://lifehacker.com/5515338/todone-assigns-you-tasks-based-on-your-available-time), which flourished all too briefly.

The premise: if you have fifteen, five, or even just one minute, you can complete something on your to-do list. This principle of creating inescapable timeboxes is the basis of productivity systems such as [the Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) and [FlyLady](http://www.flylady.net/d/br/2015/01/10/15-minutes-is-so-simple/). There's a full shelf of [self-help bestsellers](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/zorn/ct-10-minutes-lorne-holden-eileen-donnersberger-mary-dobbins-perspec-0107-20150106-column.html) guiding readers to achieve long-cherished goals through mere minutes of daily commitment. 

I Got Time For That helps you defeat procrastination. Simply choose a time period, and the application presents you with a randomly selected task you can complete in that amount of time. Stop postponing, stop dithering; start saying, "Heck, yeah, I got time for that."

## Remarks on development
I'd long mourned the removal of To-->Done from the web. Meanwhile, I procrastinated on learning more about JavaScript frameworks; the abundance of them presents the [paradox of choice](http://www.amazon.com/The-Paradox-Choice-More-Less/dp/149151423X).

Of the JavaScript frameworks, ReactJS had greatest appeal--I wasn't eager to take sides in the Ember vs. Angular debate, and I felt intrigued by [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). Recreating a beloved Rails-based utility in this most modern of JavaScript frameworks seemed an efficient use of time.
